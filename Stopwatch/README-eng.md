# Stopwatch Project <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/csharp/csharp-original.svg" height=25/>

This project is a simple console application solution with a stopwatch function. The purpose of this project is to practice the fundamentals of software development with C#. The stopwatch provides instructions for the user to insert the desired countdown time. Inputs in seconds and minutes are supported, which are converted to seconds in the transformations processes.

## Key Concepts

The project was handful to apply some programming key concepts, implemented with the C# programming language. Below is the list of  these concepts:

> * Flow control
>   * Type conversion
>   * While loop
> * String handling
> * Thread control
> * Basic OOP architecture
>   * Modularization of functionalities

## How to use

To test this application, execute in the Terminal (CMD):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbaliu-treino/101-csharp-fundamentals.git
cd ./101-csharp-fundamentals/Stopwwatch
dotnet run
```


Development Roadmap
The process of building the application, aiming to make it more robust, readable, and easy to maintain.

> * Prototype creation
> * Solution modularization: reducing redundancies
> * Docstrings
> * Error handling
